    Use a Silk Touch pickaxe to strip an ore of its gems.

    Right-click with a Silk Touch pickaxe to do use your fine motory skills and remove those gems right from the ore block. With any luck, you may repeat the procedure as long as the ore stays intact, getting more and more drops. Eventually, the ore will turn into stone and you get the usual skill points for mining.

    This method may yield as much reward as Fortune 3 but is more random. It allows multiplying drops from ores usually unaffected by Fortune: Iron and gold.
